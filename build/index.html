<h1>The PCI ID Repository</h1>
<p class="home">The home of the <code>pci.ids</code> file
</div></div>

<p>This is a public repository of all known ID's used in PCI devices:
ID's of vendors, devices, subsystems and device classes. It is used in
various programs (e.g., <a href="http://mj.ucw.cz/sw/pciutils/">The PCI Utilities</a>)
to display full human-readable names instead of cryptic numeric codes.

<h2>Browse</h2>

<p>You can use our web interface to browse the lists and also to submit new
entries or to update the existing ones:

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://admin.pci-ids.ucw.cz/read/PC/">PCI devices</a>
	<li><a href="https://admin.pci-ids.ucw.cz/read/PD/">PCI device classes</a>
</ul>

<p>You may want to read <a href="/mods/?action=help?help=index">help</a> before you start using the
web interface.

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>We generate daily snapshots of the database in form of a
<code>pci.ids</code> file. You can download the snapshot to update
the list used by your system:

<ul>
	<li><a href="/v2.2/pci.ids">pci.ids</a>
	<li><a href="/v2.2/pci.ids.gz">pci.ids.gz</a> (compressed by gzip)
	<li><a href="/v2.2/pci.ids.bz2">pci.ids.bz2</a> (compressed by bzip2)
	<li><a href="/v2.2/pci.ids.xz">pci.ids.xz</a> (compressed by xz)
</ul>

<p>The above files require pciutils v2.2 or newer. If you are still using an older
version for some reason, please get these instead: <a href="/pci.ids">pci.ids-2.0</a>,
<a href="/pci.ids.gz">pci.ids-2.0.gz</a>, or <a href="/pci.ids.bz2">pci.ids-2.0.bz2</a>. They
could however lack some subsystems.

<p>The contents of the database and the generated files can be distributed
under the terms of either the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php">GNU General Public License</a> (version 2 or later)
or of the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">3-clause BSD License.</a>
The database is a compilation of factual data, and as such the copyright
only covers the aggregation and formatting.

<p>If the snapshot is a couple of days old, it usually means that no changes
were approved recently.

<p>If you download the snapshots automatically, please put the name of your
program to the <code>User-Agent</code> HTTP header and preferably tell us
about it. Please cache the files responsively. Thousands of requests per
day from your automated build system could lead to a ban on your IP addresses.

<h2>Submit new data</h2>

<p>The database is maintained by volunteers like you, so if you have any
devices which are not identified properly, please help us by adding them
to the database or by fixing the existing entry.

<p>New entries are always welcome, but please submit only accurate information
&ndash; descriptions like "unknown modem device" are hardly useful for anybody.
of existing entries to clarify the description or to correct mistakes are also
welcome, but in this case please always add a discussion comment explaining the
reason for the change.

<p>Updates can be submitted either via the web interface, or as patches to the <code>pci.ids</code>
file sent by e-mail to our mail robot at <a href="mailto:pci-ids@ucw.cz">pci-ids@ucw.cz</a>
(see the <a href="https://admin.pci-ids.ucw.cz/mods/?action=help?help=mailsubmit">mail submit help</a>).

<p><em>In all cases, please read the <a href="https://admin.pci-ids.ucw.cz/mods/?action=help?help=newitem">submission guidelines</a>
first.</em>

<h2>Maintainers</h2>

<p>The PCI ID database is currently maintained by Albert Pool and
<a href='http://mj.ucw.cz/'>Martin Mares</a>.

<p>If you have encountered any problems or if you have any suggestions, please <a href="mailto:pci-admins@ucw.cz">let us know</a>.

<h2>Mirrors</h2>
